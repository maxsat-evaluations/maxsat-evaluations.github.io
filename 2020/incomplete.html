<h1>Incomplete Track Score</h1>

The current scoring scheme used in the incomplete track is a relative score---each solver’s score depends on the other solvers that participate. The score gives a reasonable idea of solver ranking in the evaluation, but it is difficult to apply when solver writers run their own tests.
<br>
<br>
Hence, this year we propose to use the best known cost for each instance, which is the cost of the currently best known solution for the instance. The score a solver obtains will be computed by the same expression, but this time the “cost of the best solution for i found by any solver + 1” will become the “benchmark cost + 1”:
<br>
<br>
Previous Incomplete score for a solver s on instance i: 
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&#8721<sub>i &#8712
    instances solved by some solver</sub>&nbsp(cost of
    best solution for i found by any solver + 1)<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp / (cost of solution for i
    found by solver + 1)</li>
<br>
<br>
New incomplete score: 
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&#8721<sub>i &#8712
    instances solved by some solver</sub>&nbsp(<b>cost of best known cost for i</b> + 1)<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp / (cost of solution for i
    found by solver + 1)</li>
<br>
<br>
<b>If a solver in the evaluation finds a solution with better cost than the current best known cost, the best known cost will be updated to that value and used in the evaluation scoring.</b>
<br>
<br>
The best known solution costs will be published along with the evaluation results. The current best known costs for all instances will be posted to the website
<a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/maxsat-lib/">http://www.cs.toronto.edu/maxsat-lib/</a>
<br>
<br>

In future work we encourage researchers to use the following methodology in their experiments with incomplete solvers. 
<ul>
<li>Use the most recent best known cost obtained from <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/maxsat-lib/">maxsat-lib</a> in computing scores for each solver.</li>
<li>If some solver in your experiments finds a better solution than the posted best known cost, then:
  <ul>
<li>Use that better solution cost in your scores so that each score is never greater than one.</li> 
<li>Please inform the organizers of the evaluation so that the best known cost can be updated. (Please include a v-line verifying your new better solution). </li>
<li>Include in the description of your results a discussion of any new best solutions found. </li>
</li>
</ul>
