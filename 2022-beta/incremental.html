<h1>Incremental Track</h1>

New for 2022 is the special track on incremental MaxSAT (Incremental Track for short).
The goal of the incremental track is to
evaluate the performance and applicability of MaxSAT solvers in applications requiring
solving a sequence of related MaxSAT instances.


<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>In various types of real-world applications, solving the underlying computational problem
  requires solving a sequence of
  incrementally generated optimization problem instances.
  When cast into MaxSAT, an initial MaxSAT instance is in such scenarios iteratively
  modified by
  adding (hard or soft) clauses or changing the weights of soft clauses,
  between solver invocations. Solver invocations may also be made under different assumptions
  (i.e., under different forced partial assignments to the variables of the instance).
</p>

<p>While it is possible to solve a sequence of related MaxSAT instances independently, i.e. by invoking the solver
independently on each instance in the sequence, more efficiency could be obtained by reusing
  knowledge (e.g. unsatisfiable cores, clauses learned by an internal SAT solver withing the MaxSAT solver,
  heuristic scores, etc.) between the iterations.

</p>

<p>The goal of the incremental track is to provide further incentives 
  for research on incremental MaxSAT solving towards efficiently and truly incremental open-source MaxSAT solvers,
  to provide incremental MaxSAT benchmark applications for benchmarking incremental solvers, and to provide
  a uniform interface for
incremental MaxSAT solving in order to benefit users who aim to use incremental
  MaxSAT in applications. 
  </p>



<h2>IPAMIR - the Incremental API</h2>


<p>Central to the incremental tracks is the now-introduced standard incremental MaxSAT solving interface <a href="https://bitbucket.org/coreo-group/ipamir">IPAMIR</a>.
  The interface extends the already established
<a href=https://github.com/biotomas/ipasir>IPASIR</a> API for incremental SAT [1,2]. 
The IPAMIR interface consists of 10 functions declared in a C header `ipamir.h`:

ipamir_signature, ipamir_init, ipamir_release, ipamir_add_hard,
ipamir_add_soft_lit, ipamir_assume, ipamir_solve, ipamir_val_obj, ipamir_val_lit,
ipamir_set_terminate

<p>IPAMIR assumes all instances are in so-called normalized form. More specifically,
instead of inputting hard and soft clauses separately, applications should input
hard clauses (via the ipamir_add_hard function) and declare weighted soft
literals (via the ipamir_add_soft_lit function). From a clausal perspective,
declaring a literal l soft with weight w corresponds to adding the soft clause
(~l) and setting its weight to w. More details of the interface can be found in
the comments of the header file.

<p>Solvers may implement any subset of these functions, and benchmarks may make use
of any subset of them. That is, you may participate in the incremental track
without defining each function. However, the solver must enter state ERROR if
the user calls a function which is not supported. For example, if your solver
does not support assumptions over literals, after calling ipamir_assume all
subsequent ipamir_solve calls must return ERROR. This must be the case also if
a sequence of calls is performed in a way that is not supported, e.g., if the
user changes the weight of a soft clause by calling ipamir_add_soft_lit after
ipamir_solve on an already defined soft literal.</p>

<h2>Solver Submissions to the Incremental Track</h2>

<p>
To submit a solver to the incremental track, implement a subset of functions defined in the IPAMIR header file as described in the comments of the header file.
If your solver does not provide support for a particular function, the solver state must be changed to ERROR.
Place your solver into a directory named after the solver. Issuing make in this directory must result in a successful build of the solver as a static library.
Please see the maxsat/solver2022 directory in <a href="https://bitbucket.org/coreo-group/ipamir">the IPAMIR repository</a> for an example (non-incremental) solver.
Submit your solver as a single zip or gzipped tar package via email to <a href="mailto:maxsatevaluation@gmail.com">maxsatevaluation@gmail.com</a> using the subject title "MSE22 solver submission" <b>by May 15 the latest</b>.
</p>


<h2>Incremental Track Rankings and Correctness</h2>

<p>(See also the <a href="rules.html">general rules</a>.)
  In the incremental track, all solvers will be ranked on each benchmark application independently. For a specific benchmark application, the rank of a solver is determined by the number of solved instances for that benchmark. Solving an instance means that all invocations of the solver are correct, i.e. correctly return either OPTIMUM FOUND or UNSAT as specified in the IPAMIR header.
</p>

<p>Following the ideals of the evaluations and taking also into account the fact
  that the incremental track is now organized for the first time, 
a solver will not be immediate
        disqualified if it displays a wrong solution during the
        execution of the evaluation. The organizers will aim to
        provide all participants a fair chance of submitting bug fixes.
A solver in
  the incremental track is considered buggy if it
  does not correctly implement ipamir_solve, ipamir_val_lit or ipamir_val_obj
    as specified in the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/coreo-group/ipamir">IPAMIR header</a>.
</p>

<h2>Benchmark Examples</h2>

!!! On the webpage we should probably unify description either to soft literals or clauses. But 
for contacting potential application developers clauses are probably better.... !!!!

<ol type="1">
  <li> <b>MaxSAT-based CEGAR for argumentation dynamics</b>. A MaxSAT solver is called
    iteratively on an abstraction of the instance, obtaining a solution candidate
    from the optimal truth assignment. The candidate is checked for counterexamples
    using an external SAT solver call (implemented using Minisat 2.2). If one is
    found, the abstraction is refined by adding a hard clause. Otherwise, the
    candidate solution is an actual solution, and the optimal truth assignment is
    printed. <br><br>
    <b>Input:</b> Argumentation framework in APX format (see <a href=TODO>TODO: link</a>). <br>
    <b>Incremental (i.e. between solver calls) functionality required:</b> adding hard clauses. <br>
    <b>Ipamir functions required:</b> ipamir_add_hard, ipamir_val_lit <br>
    <b>Output:</b> Optimal objective value and truth assignment.
    <br><br>
  <li> <b>MaxSAT for learning boosted decision trees</b>. A MaxSAT solver is called
    iteratively on an instance that initially has unit weights on all soft clauses. 
    Between iterations, weights of satisfied soft clauses are lowered 
    and weights of falsified soft clauses are increased, resulting in
    diverse solutions. The benchmark exits after a fixed number of iterations.
    <br><br>
    <b>Input:</b> Binary dataset in CSV format. <br>
    <b>Incremental (i.e. between solver calls) functionality required:</b> changing weights of soft clauses.<br>
    <b>Ipamir functions required:</b> ipamir_set_weight, ipamir_val_lit <br>
    <b>Output:</b> All optimal objective values and truth assignments.
    <br><br>
  <li><b>MaxSAT for regularization parameter sweep</b> A MaxSAT solver is called
    iteratively on an instance with soft clauses having two different weights w_1 or
    w_2 initially with w_1 < w_2. Between iterations, the weights of soft clauses are adjusted by 
    increasign the value of w_1 and decreasing the value of w_2. The benchmark exits after a 
    fixed number of iterations.  
    <br><br>
    <b>Input:</b> Binary dataset in CSV format. <br>
    <b>Incremental (i.e. between solver calls) functionality required:</b> changing weights of soft clauses.<br>
    <b>Ipamir functions required:</b> ipamir_set_weight <br>
    <b>Output:</b> All optimal objective values and truth assignments.
