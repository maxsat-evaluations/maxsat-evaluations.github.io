<h1>Rules</h1>

<h2>General</h2>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Ranking</b>:
      <ul>
	<li><i>Main tracks</i> and <i>No-restrictions track:</i> Solvers 
will be ranked based on the number
	of solved instances within predefined per-instance resource
	limitations. In the main tracks and the no-restrictions track solving an instance means finding
	an optimal solution.</li>
	<li><i>Incomplete track:</i> Solvers participating in the
	  incomplete tracks will be ranked using a incomplete score that is
	  computed by the sum of the ratios between the best solution
	  found by a given solver and the best solution found by all
	  solvers.<br>Incomplete score:
     <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&#8721<sub>i &#8712
	  instances solved by some solver</sub>&nbsp(cost of solution for i
	  found by solver)<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp/ (cost of
	  best solution for i found by any solver)
	    </li>
	    </ul>
    <li><b>Disqualification:</b> A solver will not be immediate
        disqualified if it displays a wrong solution during the
        execution of the evaluation. The organizers will aim to
        provide all participants a fair chance of submitting bug fixes
        to their solvers in a timely manner based on feedback on wrong
        results. However, the organizers reserve the right to limit
        the number of resubmissions of a buggy solver based on
        resource limitations.  A solver is considered buggy under the
        following circumstances.
      <ul>
        <li> The solver in either track reports a truth assignment in
          a "v" line that does not satisfy the hard clauses.
        <li> The solver in the main track reports "s OPTIMUM FOUND"
          but the truth assignment reported in its "v" line has cost
          higher than another known solution.
        <li> The solver in either track reports a cost on its "o"
          that does not match the actual cost of the truth assignment
          reported on the "v" line.
        <li> The solver crashes on a significant number of instances.
	    </ul>
      If the solver's bug cannot be resolved, the submitters will
      still have the option of having the solver's correct results
      tabulated and reported in the table of results. However, the
      results will be marked to indicate that the solver also
      generated some incorrect results.

    <li><b>Withdrawal</b>: A solver can be withdrawn from the MaxSAT
    Evaluation 2017 only before the deadline for the submission of the
    final versions. After this deadline no further changes or
    withdrawals of the solvers are possible.</li>
    <li><b>Number of solver submissions</b>: The evaluation organizers
    reserve the right to restrict the number of solver submissions
    originating from the same author(s) based on computation resource
    limitations.</li>

    </p>

<h2>Solver Submissions</h2>

<p>Each solver submission must adhere to the following specification.
<ul>
<li><b>Input and output format</b>: Solvers must accept as input
MaxSAT instances in <a href="#input">the standard WCNF format</a>, and
conform to <a href="#output">the output format specified
here</a>.
<a name=sigterm></a>
<li><b>SIGTERM:</b> At the time limit solvers will receive a SIGTERM
  signal shortly before being forcibly terminated by a SIGKILL signal.
  <p>Incomplete solvers must catch the SIGTERM signal at which point
  they can output the best solution they have found so far with a "o"
  and "v" line (if a solution has been found), and then
  terminate. 

  <p>Exact solvers in the main track, only need to output an optimal
  solution, and can terminate after finding and outputting one. So
  there is no real need for them to catch the SIGTERM signal as no score is
  associated with outputting the best solution found if that solution
  is not optimal.</p>

  <p><i>Catching the SIGTERM signal on StarExec</i><br> StarExec is
  currently sending a SIGTERM followed by a SIGKILL signal with
  minimal delay. The time gap between SIGTERM and SIGKILL might not be
  sufficient for your program to output its best solution. But we
  suggest you try that first making sure to assemble all output before
  finally flushing the output stream (multiple flush commands will
  take more time). 

  To address this issue we are in the process of incorporating a
  longer delay to the StarExec platform that should be sufficient for
  your program to complete its output.

  In the meantime, if you want to test that your solver is properly
  catching SIGTERM and then outputting its best solution, and have
  found that StarExec's delay is too short then we can suggest two
  other methods.

  <ol>
  <li><b>Include the "runsolver" tool in your solver package.</b>
  <a href="https://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/~roussel/runsolver/runsolver-3.3.5.tar.bz2">runsolver</a>
  is a tool to control the memory and runtime of a solver. After
  downloading and statically compiling "runsolver", you can include
  "runsolver" in your bin directory when uploading your solver to
  StarExed. Then you can change your StarExec configuration script
  (see <a href="submission.html#solversubmission"> solver
  submission</a>) so that runs your solver under "runsolver"'s control
  as follows:

  <pre>
  #!/bin/bash
  delay=3
  cpu=$(($STAREXEC_CPU_LIMIT-$delay-1))
  wl=$(($STAREXEC_WALLCLOCK_LIMIT-$delay-1))

  ./runsolver -d $delay -C $cpu -W $wl -v out.v -w out.w ./&#60your_solver_binary&#62 $1
  </pre><br> which will send a SIGTERM signal and after the "delay"
  (in this case 3 seconds) will send a SIGKILL signal to your
  solver. To verify if your solver is receiving the SIGTERM signal
  properly, we suggest that you try using "runsolver" offline and
  verify that your solver is receiving and outputting a solution when
  a SIGTERM signal is sent.
  </p>

  <li> <b>Run your solver using the linux "timeout" command.</b>
    Again you would modify your StarExec configuration script, but
    this time there is no need to upload runsolver. Instead you invoke your solver as follows:

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
delay=3
wl=$(($STAREXEC_WALLCLOCK_LIMIT-$delay))
timeout -s 15 &#60wl&#62 ./&#60your_solver_binary&#62 $1 
</pre><br>Where &#60wl&#62 is the runtime for your solver
minus the delay in seconds that you want to have between SIGTERM and
SIGKILL (when you create a StarExec job set the job's timeout to be
greater than &#60delay&#62). This will cause the system to
send your solver a SIGTERM signal after &#60delay&#62 seconds,
after which StarExec will terminate your solver at its timeout.
</ol>
</li>

<a name=source></a>
<li><b>Use of Processor Cores</b>: In each track, solvers much use only 
a single core of the processor on the computing node it is run on.
Solvers making use of multiple cores (for parallel computations) will be disqualified.
<li><b>Open source requirement</b> for the <i>Main and Incomplete Tracks</i>: 
Solver source code originating
  from the authors (including modifications to third-party source code
  such as SAT solvers as part of a solver) must be submitted together
  with a corresponding solver binary that can be directly run on
  StarExec. The source code package of each solver participating in
  the evaluation will be made available at the time when the MaxSAT
  Evaluation 2017 results are presented at the SAT 2017 conference. In
  case bug fixes are submitted during the evaluation (i.e., if
  requested by the evaluation organizers), the bug-fixed source
  package must also be submitted together with a bug-fixed solver
  binary.  <i>A solver is allowed to use external binaries of
  unmodified third-party libraries. Source code need not be submitted
  for such libraries. However, if the library is non-standard (i.e.,
  not STL, Boost, etc.) its identity and usage in the solver should be
  clearly specified in the solver description.</i></li>
<a name=description></a>
<li><b>Solver description</b>:
    Each entrant to the MaxSAT Evaluation 2017 <b>must include</b> a short (at least 1, at most 2 pages) description of the system.
    This should include a list of all authors of the system and their present institutional
    affiliations.
    It should also provide details of any non-standard algorithmic techniques (e.g., heuristics, simplification/learning techniques, etc.)
    and data structures, as well as references to relevant literature (be they by the authors themselves or by others).
    
    The system description must be formatted in <a href="http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE Proceedings style</a>, and submitted as PDF.
    The system descriptions will be posted on the MaxSAT Evaluation 2017 website.
    Furthermore, given that the quality and number of system descriptions is
    high enough, the organizers are considering publishing the collection of
    system description as a report under the report series of Department of
    Computer Science, University of Helsinki (with ISSN and ISBN numbers).
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Benchmarks</h2>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>The benchmark sets used in the evaluation will consists of both instances appearing in the earlier MaxSAT evaluation benchmark sets as well as new unseen benchmarks.</li>
      <li>The set of benchmarks used in the evaluation will be revealed only after the results from the evaluation are presented at the SAT 2017 conference</li>
      <li>The number of benchmarks used in the evaluation is not predetermined.</li>
      <li>The benchmark selection procedures used consists of two steps. 1. The organizers will divide accessible benchmarks into buckets consisting of "similar" benchmark instances (e.g., originating from the same or similar problem domain). 2. Benchmarks will be drawn randomly one-by-one from each of the buckets, so that a balanced number of benchmarks over the buckets is obtained.</li>
      <li><b>The organizers are allowed to enter their own solvers
      into the evaluation.</b> To avoid providing them with any
      advantage over other participants (a) the composition of the
      buckets will be made public, and (b) the organizers will have
      no influence on the seed used for the random process that
      chooses the instances.
      </ul>
    </p>

<a name=input></a>
        <h2>Input format</h2>
        <p>The input file must be read from the file given as a parameter to your solver. For example:</p>
<p>
        <pre>./mysolver &#060;input_file_name&#062;</pre>
   </p>     
        <p>In MaxSAT Evaluation 2017, the same input format is used
        for all benchmark instances. The parameters line is "p
        wcnf <i>nbvar</i> <i>nbclauses</i> <i>top</i>". We associate a
        weight with each clause, which is the first integer in the
        clause. Weights must be greater than or equal to 1, and
        smaller than 2<sup>63</sup>. The sum of the weights must be
        less than 2<sup>64</sup>-1. Hard clauses have
        weight <i>top</i> and soft clauses have a weight smaller
        than <i>top</i>. <i>top</i> will always be greater than the
        sum of the soft clause weights.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
<p>
        <pre>c<br>c comment line<br>c<br>p wcnf 4 5 16<br>16 1 -2 4 0<br>16 -1 -2 3 0<br>8 -2 -4 0<br>4 -3 2 0<br>3 1 3 0</pre>
</p>
<a name=output></a>
        <h2>Output format</h2>
        <p>The solvers must output messages to standard output that
        will be used to check the results. The output format is
        inspired by the DIMACS output specification of the SAT
        competition and will be used to check some results.</p>
        <p> The solver cannot write to any files except standard output and standard error (only standard output will be parsed for results, but both output and error will be memorized during the whole evaluation process, for all executions).</p>
        <h3>Messages</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Comments ("c " lines):</strong><br>
                These lines start by the two characters: lower case 'c' followed by a space (ASCII code 32).<br>
                These lines are optional and may appear anywhere in the solver output.<br>
                They contain any information that authors want to emphasize, such as #backtracks, #flips,... or internal cpu-time.<br>
                Submitters are advised to avoid outputting comment lines which may be useful in an interactive environment but otherwise useless in a batch environment.<br>
            </li>
            <br>
              <li>
                <strong>Solution Status ("s " line):</strong><br> This
                line starts by the two characters: lower case 's'
                followed by a space (ASCII code 32).<br>  Only one
                such line is allowed.<br> This line gives the answer
                of the solver. It must be one of the following
                answers:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <pre>s OPTIMUM FOUND</pre> This line is to
                        output when the solver has checked that the
                        last "o" and "v" lines specify an optimal
                        solution.<br>
                    <li>
                      <pre>s UNSATISFIABLE</pre> This line is to be
                      output when the solves has checked that the
                      set of hard clauses is unsatisfiable.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <pre>s UNKNOWN</pre> This line must be output in
                      any other case. Note that solvers in the
                      incomplete track will typically output "s
                      UNKNOWN" unless they can verify that the best
                      solution they have found is optimal, in which
                      case they can output "s OPTIMUM FOUND". However,
                      no extra score will be associated in the
                      incomplete track for proving optimality. Exact
                      solvers in the main track can output "s UNKNOWN"
                      if they are unable to find a optimal solution
                      (note that not outputting an "s" line is the
                      same as outputting "s UNKNOWN") <br>
                      </li>
               </ul>
                    <p>It is of uttermost importance to respect the exact
                      spelling of these answers. Any mistake in the writing
                      of these lines will cause the answer to be
                      disregarded.</p>
                    <p> If the solver does not display a "s" line (or
                      if the "s" is not valid), then UNKNOWN will be
                      assumed.</p>
                        </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Solution Cost Line ("o " lines):</strong><br>
                These lines start by the two characters: lower case
                'o' followed by a space (ASCII code 32).<br>  An "o "
                line must contain the lower case 'o' followed by a
                space and then by an integer which represents the cost
                of the best solution found, i.e., the sum of the
                weights of clauses falsified by the solution.<br>
                    
                Incomplete solvers should field the SIGTERM signal so
                as to output an "o" (and "v") line specifying the best
                solution found just before termination. There is no
                need for exact solvers in the main track to output any
                solution other than an optimal one. When they find an
                optimal solution they can output an "o" and "v" line
                specifying the solution they found. <br>
            </li>
            <br>
                        <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Solution Values (Truth Assignment) ("v "
                lines):</strong><br> These lines start by the two
                characters: lower case 'v' followed by a space (ASCII
                code 32).<br>  More than one "v " line is allowed but
                the evaluation environment will act as if their
                content was merged.<br>  When the solver reports a
                solution it must provide "s", "o" and "v" lines. The
                "v" line provides a truth assignment to the variables
                of the instance that will be used to check the
                correctness of the answer, i.e., it must provide a
                list of non-complementary literals which, when
                interpreted as true, achieves a sum of weights of
                unsatisfied clauses as specified in the "o" line.<br>
                A literal is denoted by an integer that identifies the
                variable and the negation of a literal is denoted by a
                minus sign immediately followed by the integer of the
                variable.<br>  The solution line must define the value
                of each variable. The order of literals does not
                matter.<br>  If the solver does not output a value
                line, or if the value line does not match the
                specification, then UNKNOWN will be assumed.
            </li>
        </ul>
        All the lines must be ended by a standard Unix end of line character ('\n');
        <p><b>Multiple "o" lines</b><br> Although the solver can
            output a new "o" line every time it finds a better
            solution, there is no score associated with doing so. Only
            one "s" line is allowed and all "v" lines are merged,
            hence only one truth assignment can be
            specified. Therefore, the intermediate "o" lines cannot be
            verified by information in the output and will be ignored
            in the evaluation. Only the last "o" line will be used
            (and it must match the data specified in the "v" line).
