<h2>Solver Submissions: Main Tracks (Exact and Anytime)</h2>
<p><b>Note:</b> Even if the anytime track will be not be run StarExec this year(as detailed <a href=execution.html>here</a>), participating 
solvers should  still be submitted following the procedure detailed in this section. We strongly encourage submitting your solver as a 
statically linked solvers that run on StarExec.</p>

<p> Solvers need to be submitted <s>by June 10 the latest</s> <b>Note: Due to some last minute technical difficulties with StarExec we 
  are accepting solvers until June 14th AoE</b>
</b>. We encourage the participants to test
their 
solvers within the execution environment well in advance.
The exact track of MSE 2024 will be using the <b>StarExec</b> system which supports
experimental evaluation of logic solvers. All interaction with
StarExec is preformed via its web
interface at <a href="https://www.starexec.org">https://starexec.org</a>


To submit a solver you will need to prepare a zip or tar file (the
suffix needs to be .zip, .tar, tar.gz, or .tgz) with the following
file and directory structure
<pre>
./starexec_description.txt
./bin/&#60your_solver_binary&#62
./bin/starexec_run_default
./code/&#60your_source_tree&#62
./doc/&#60your_solver_description&#62.pdf
</pre><br>

<ul>
  <li> ./starexec_description.txt is a short text description of our
    solver (1204 characters max.). This file is optional; you can instead
    enter the description directly in the upload page.
  <li> ./bin/solver_binary is your executable.
  <li> ./bin/starexec_run_default is a
    StarExec <b>configuration</b>. It is just a shell script used to
    invoke your solver. A bare bones version would be <br><br>
<pre>
#!/bin/bash
./&#60your_solver_binary&#62 $1 
</pre><br> which will invoke your solver on an input file passed into
the script as the $1 variable. More elaborate versions might supply
various parameter settings to your solver. 

  <li>./code/ is where you place
  your <a href="rules.html#source">source code</a> (which can be in a 
    directory tree).
    <li>./doc/ is where you place your <a href="rules.html#description">PDF formatted description</a> of
    your solver.
</ul>  

<h3>Testing Your Solver Prior to Submissison</h3>
<p>The organizers strongly urge developers to test their solvers prior to submitting them. 
As of 2024, a solver in the main tracks needs to pass a <a href=https://github.com/tobipaxe/MaxSATRegressionSuite/tree/main>regression suite</a> of small instances which caused at least one solver from
the last evaluation to crash.</p>

<p>Further testing of solvers can be done with the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/fbacchus/maxsat_benchmarks_code_base/src/master/">verify_soln</a>
tool.
When invoked on a WCNF instance and a solver output, the tool will check that the (i) all hard clauses are satisfied, 
(ii) the solution provided in the 'v' line matches the value of the last 'o' line.
Later in the spring, we will also publish a more extensive fuzzer for testing solvers.
Details on the fuzzer will be anounced later. </p>

<h3>Using StarExec</h3>

<h4>Getting an account</h4>

<p>
  Register for an account in the MaxSAT community (unless you are
  already registered).  Wait until one of the MaxSAT community leaders
  approves your request (this should not take more than 24h).</p>

<h4>
  Uploading a solver for testing</h4>

<p>
 A solver is submitted by uploading an archive as specified
 above. Note however that StarExec runs an older version of Linux and
 so dynamically linked binaries are likely to fail. A statically
 linked binary should work.

<p><i>Building your Solver on StarExec</i><br> Otherwise you can
 modify your archive to include a build script, in which case your
 solver will be built on the StarExec system on upload. To do this you
 include a script "starexec_build" at the top level of your archive
 file. On upload StarExec will detect if this file exists and execute
 it to build your solver. Note that your archive must still include
 the other files specified above (as well as, of course, any Make file
 or other files you need to perform the build). It is also recommended
 that your build create a static executable. See
 the <a href="https://wiki.uiowa.edu/display/stardev/User+Guide">StarExec
 Users Guide for more details</a>.

<p><i>To upload your solver to StarExec</i><br>Login to the StarExec
  website and click Spaces->Explore (on the top) then in the left
  frame open root->MaxSAT->MSE2024->Testing At the bottom of page click
  "upload solver" to open the upload dialog.  Click "Browse" and
  select the archive with your solvers code, enter the solver name,
  change downloadable to "no" (so as to keep your source code hidden
  until the submission deadline is over) and click "upload".
</p>

<a name=testing></a>
  <h4>Testing that your solver runs on StarExec</h4>

 <p>
  We will put a few testing instances in the MSE2024->Testing->Exact and ->Testing->Anytime spaces which you can 
  use after you uploaded your solver to these spaces. To run a test:
</p>
 <p>
  Go to the root->MaxSAT->MSE2024->Testing->Exact->Weighted subspace (other subspaces exist for the Exact/Anytime 
  and Unweighted/Weighted combinations).
  Click "create job" on the bottom of the page. This opens a page where you don't need to change anything so just click "next"
  On the next page select the "choose" option and then "all in MSE2024->Testing->Exact->Weighted"
  A page with all solvers (and their configurations) comes up, select the solver you want to run and click "submit" at the bottom 
  of the page.
  You can check out the status and results of your test job by clicking on Jobs on the top and selecting your job.</p>
 
  <p><i>To check the output of your job and the correctness of your solution</i><br>
  Once the job is finished, 
  you can check the logs of your solver by downloading the "job output" in the job webpage. 
  You can also download the "job information" that will contain a .csv file with a summary of your job. 
  This .csv file will contain default attributes such as "benchmark id", "solver", "wallclock time", 
  "memory usage" as well as checker attributes such as "optimum_solution",  "hard_clauses",  "optimum". 
  <b>Any errors encountered will need to be fixed prior to the submission of the final solver. </b>
  </p>

 <h4>Uploading the final version of your solver</h4>

 <p>
   The submission of the final version of a solver is essentially the same as uploading the solver for testing (see above). 
   To submit the final version of your solver upload it to the space root->MaxSAT->MSE2024->Evaluation->[track], where [track] 
   is one of Exact->Unweighted, Exact->Weighted, Anytime->Unweighted, Anytime->Weighted, depending on the track you want to 
   participate in. If you want to participate in several tracks upload your solver to each one of them separately.
 </p>

 <p>
 Don't forget to select "downloadable:no" when uploading your solver to prevent other participants 
 from seeing your source code before the start of the evaluation. <b>After the solver submission deadline we will ask all the 
  participants to update the downloadable option to "downloadable:yes".</b> This will make the source code visible to the organizers 
  and all the participants. The participants must comply with this request in order to participate in the evaluation.
 </p>


<h2>Solver Submissions: Incremental Track</h2> 

<p>
To submit a solver to the incremental track, implement a subset of functions defined in the IPAMIR header file as described in the 
comments of the header file.
If your solver does not provide support for a particular function, the solver state must be changed to ERROR.
Place your solver into a directory named after the solver. Issuing make in this directory must result in a successful build of the 
solver as a static library.
Please see the maxsat/solver2023 directory in <a href="https://bitbucket.org/coreo-group/ipamir">the IPAMIR repository</a> for an 
example (non-incremental) solver.
Submit your solver as a single zip or gzipped tar package via email to <a href="mailto:maxsatevaluation@gmail.com">maxsatevaluation@gmail.com</a> 
using the subject title "MSE24 solver submission" <b>by May 15 the latest</b>.
