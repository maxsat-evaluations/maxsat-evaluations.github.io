# To Preview the page 
Requires a local server. 
Simplest way to achieve this is to run 
```
python3 -m http.server
```

for newer python instalations or 
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
after which the site renders in localhost:8000.



# To Make New Page

- Add the contents of your page into an .html file in the contents directory
- Alter the argument on line 23 of "template-for-new-page.html"  to point to the .html file created in the previous step. 
    - leave out the extension .html.
