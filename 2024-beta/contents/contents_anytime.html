<h1>Anytime Track Score</h1>

<p>
The solvers are ranked based on the following anytime score.
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&#8721<sub>i &#8712
    instances solved by some solver</sub>&nbsp(<b>cost of best known cost for i</b> + 1)<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp / (cost of solution for i
    found by solver + 1)</li>
</p>
<p>
If a solver in the evaluation finds a solution with better cost than the current best known cost, the best known cost will be updated to that value and used in the evaluation scoring.
</p>
<p>
  The best known solution costs will be published along with the evaluation results.
