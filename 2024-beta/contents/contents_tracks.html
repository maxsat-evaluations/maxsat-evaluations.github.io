<h1>Tracks</h1>

<p>Note: The ranking criteria for the individual  tracks are described under <a href="rules.html">rules</a>.
</p>
   
<p>Solvers can be submitted for evaluation in the following tracks.
  Please note that MSE 2024
<i>does not include a track for randomly generated MaxSAT instances</i>.

<h3>Main Tracks for Exact Solvers (formerly "Complete Solvers")</h3>
<p> 
<ul>
<li><b>Unweighted</b>: Combines the <i>industrial</i> and <i>crafted</i> unweighted and unweighted partial 
 MaxSAT categories from
previous MaxSAT evaluations. Purely randomly generated instances are not included.
<li><b>Weighted</b>: Combines the <i>industrial</i> and <i>crafted</i> weighted and weighted partial 
MaxSAT categories from  previous MaxSAT evaluations. All benchmarks will be truly weighted, i.e., 
contain soft clauses with different weights. Purely randomly generated instances are not included.
</ul>
</p>


<h3>Main Tracks for Anytime Solvers (formerly "Incomplete Solvers")</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Two tracks: <b>unweighted</b> and <b>weighted</b> (following the categorization of the main tracks), for <i>anytime</i> 
    solvers are organized. Every anytime solver participating in one or both of the tracks will be evaluated using two 
    distinct per-instance time limits: 60 seconds and 300 seconds.
    The ranking criterion for these tracks is described under <a href="rules.html">rules</a>.
</ul>

<h3>Special Track on Incremental MaxSAT</h3>
