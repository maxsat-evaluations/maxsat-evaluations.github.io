<h2>Additions to Rules in 2024</h2>
<ul>
  <li"> 
    Each solver must pass a regression suite
    consisting of small instances which caused at least one solver from
    the last evaluation to crash. The regression suite will be published
    latest at the end of march.
  </li>
        
</ul>
<p>A solver is <b>not</b> allowed 
  to use external binaries (including commercial MIP solvers) of
  unmodified third-party libraries. Open-source libraries are allowed.
</p>
<ul>
    <li"> 
      <strong>Solver Exit Codes:</strong><br>
      As in the incremental track, the solver must return one of the following exit codes:
      <ul>
        <li> <b>0</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;if it cannot find a solution or prove unsatisfiability.</li>
        <li> <b>10</b> if a solution satisfying the hard clauses is found but not proven to be optimal.</li>
        <li> <b>20</b> if it finds that the hard clauses are unsatisfiable.</li>
        <li> <b>30</b> if it finds an optimal solution.</li>
      </ul>
    </li> 
</ul>
        
<h2>Recommendations on Solver Development</h2>
  <br>
  <p>As the yearly MaxSAT Evaluation drives MaxSAT 
  solver development forward, we want to recommend the following 
  standardizations to the solvers to make them easier to use.
  These suggestions are in line with the mathematical logic of the Boolean 
  satisfiability problem. </p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>An empty instance should yield a weight "o 0", with an empty model line "v" and the status line "s OPTIMUM FOUND".</li>
      <li>An empty hard clause should result in an unsatisfiable instance.</li>
      <li>An empty soft clause should be considered unsatisfied by all solutions and thus incur cost.</li>
      <li>A solver should accept weight 0 for a soft clause.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p><b>We emphasize that all benchmark sets used in the evaluation and in the regression suite contain only 
  non-empty hard and soft clauses.</b> These suggestions should be taken 
  as reccomendations and topics for discussion. Similar topics are currently discussed in 
  the SAT solving community as well where some solvers, like kissat and CaDiCaL, can handle empty 
  instances/clauses, while others cannot. </p>


<h3>New MaxSAT Fuzzer and Regression Suite</h3>
  We further want to advertise the use of a 
  <b>regression suite</b> which provides a set of 
  small valid instances known to have caused 
  issues in a previous solver.
  <b>All solvers submitted to the main tracks need to pass the regression suite.</b>

  <br>
  Further, we plan to provide a <b>MaxSAT fuzzing toolsuite</b> 
  (new release in a GitHub repository probably at the end of March) 
  for exhaustive testing of MaxSAT solvers. 
  This toolsuite compares the solution of your solver 
  with any existing solver which complies to the 
  rules of the MaxSAT Evaluation. It compares if the "o-value"
  is the same as the value provided by your model and if no 
  other solver (e.g. a verified MaxSAT solver) 
  can produce a better solution output with a 
  correct model. It further is able to recognize solver
  crashes on valid instances (it does not produce empty 
  clauses or instances). Then it minimizes the instance
  with a delta debugging algorithm to provide simple 
  instances for debugging.
