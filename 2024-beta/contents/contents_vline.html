<h1>The v-line Format for Outputting Solutions</h1>

<p>The new v-line format introduced in 2022 will be used.
An example v-line in the current format is:
<code>v 011011000110001111</code>
This is equivalent to
<code>v -1 2 3 -4 5 6 -7 -8 -9 10 11 -12 -13 -14 15 16 17 18</code>                                                           in the pre-2022 format. That is, the line start with 'v ' and is followed by the solution as a bitstring, where the i'th bit gives the value (0 or 1) assigned to variable having the index i.
